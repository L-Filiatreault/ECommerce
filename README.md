This project was created while following along with this tutorial from LinkedIn Learning: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-microservices-with-dot-net-core-for-developers

I created and applied my knowledge of web development from my previous courses and current Web Programming III course to create an E-Commerce microservice site. It was 
my introduction to microservices architectural pattern. It gave insight as how this framework can create reliability, scalability and availability in modern cloud computing software.
